# Train-Simulation-
this is fundamental oop for simple train simulation


We will simulate the network of intercity trains. In this simulation, we have a main shape that is a symbol of the elapsed time. By using this time, we find out what stage of the simulation we are in. By using this, we are supposed to get the location and conditions of people and trains at any time.
